# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Feature Detection

This project demonstrates **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in action by visualizing how they detect and process features in images.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Use CNNs to extract and visualize features from an image of a lion by applying convolutional and pooling operations.
- **Result**: Feature maps and pooled outputs demonstrate how CNNs break down images into edges, textures, and patterns.

## Files Included
1. **`lion.png`**: The original lion image used for processing.
2. **`conv2d_18.png`**: Feature map generated by the 18th convolutional layer.
3. **`conv2d_19.png`**: Feature map generated by the 19th convolutional layer.
4. **`max_pooling2d_18.png`**: Result of applying max pooling to the 18th convolutional layer's output.
5. **`max_pooling2d_19.png`**: Result of applying max pooling to the 19th convolutional layer's output.
6. **`cnn_feature_detection.py`**: Python script implementing and visualizing the CNN exercise.

## Key Concepts Highlighted
- **Convolutional Layers**: Detect features like edges and patterns using learnable filters.
- **Max Pooling**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of feature maps while retaining key features, improving computational efficiency.
- **Feature Visualization**: Illustrates how CNNs process images step-by-step.

## Instructions
To reproduce this project:
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (`TensorFlow`, `Matplotlib`, etc.).
2. Run the `cnn_feature_detection.py` script to process the lion image and generate feature maps and pooled outputs.
3. Visualize the results on the **"Image Feature Detection with CNNs"** page in the Streamlit portfolio.

## Fun Fact
Did you know that CNNs were inspired by the visual cortex of animals? They mimic how neurons respond to visual stimuli by detecting features like edges and textures!
