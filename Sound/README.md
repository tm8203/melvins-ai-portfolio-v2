# Sound Analysis

This project demonstrates how audio data can be transformed into visual spectrograms to analyze patterns in frequency and amplitude.

## Files Included
1. **`sound_analysis.py`**: The Python script for analyzing and visualizing sound.
2. **`audio/`**: A folder with sound files grouped into categories.

## How It Works
- Choose a category from the sidebar (e.g., "dog," "eight," or "happy").
- Select a file to play the audio and view its spectrogram.
- Spectrograms visualize how the frequency of sound changes over time.

## Fun Fact
Spectrograms are widely used in applications like speech recognition, audio classification, and music analysis!
