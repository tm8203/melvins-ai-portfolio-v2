# Neural Style Transfer (NST) Project

This project demonstrates **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** by blending a personal photo with an artistic image using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Use NST to combine the content of a personal photo with the style of a Kandinsky painting.
- **Result**: The final image blends the structural elements of the photo with the vibrant, artistic strokes of Kandinsky's style.

## Files Included
1. **`photo.jpg`**: The original photo used for the content.
2. **`vii.jpg`**: The Kandinsky painting used as the style reference.
3. **`result.jpg`**: The output image showcasing the result of NST.
4. **`nst_project.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook that walks through the NST process step-by-step.

## Fun Fact
Did you know that Neural Style Transfer was inspired by how the human brain processes visual input? Content and style are processed separately, which is why deep learning can mimic artistic styles so effectively!

## Instructions
To reproduce this project:
1. Open the `nst_project.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (`TensorFlow`, `Matplotlib`, etc.).
3. Run the notebook to see how the NST process works and generate the result on your machine.
